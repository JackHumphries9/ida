<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This project is a side project that I worked on in school. I basically worked on it whenever I got some free time. Now looking back at this, it is proper spaghetti code. It has many features though such as saving and opening files. You can even change the font family and font colour. A disclaimer though, it is terribly unstable and there are many bugs which I may fix one day.


### Built With

* [Python](https://python.org)
* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

### Installation
You need Python 3 installed to run this. Python 2 is not supported.

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JackHumphries9/ida.git
```

EXTRA STEP FOR LINUX:
If you are on Linux, you may need to install tkinter using the package manager. On debian based systems do:
```
sudo apt install python-tk
```

2. Run the code
```
cd ida && python3 main.py
```
